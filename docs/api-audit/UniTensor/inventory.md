# UniTensor — categorized member inventory

> The master member list for `cytnx.UniTensor` (wheel **1.1.0**). Every public
> member of `dir(cytnx.UniTensor)` (126 non-underscore names) is assigned to
> **exactly one** of the twelve categories below — the categories *partition*
> the live surface. This file is the index; the per-category documents hold the
> analysis, the normative spec (`# R.`), and the probe-backed evidence.

**How to read this.** Each `## NN — <category>` section links its category
document and lists that category's live members with a one-line role. Names
tagged **(plumbing)** are raw C++/pybind bindings that leak into the public
namespace but are *not* public API — they are collected again, with their public
wrapper, in [`## Internal / plumbing`](#internal--plumbing-not-public-api) at the
end. The dunder members (`__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, the operator dunders,
`__repr__`, the pickle/copy hooks) are handled inside their owning category
document (06, 07, 11, 12) and are not repeated here.

**Provenance / gates.**
- Category documents: `docs/api-audit/UniTensor/NN-*.md` (01–12).
- Method spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-06-cytnx-api-analysis-method-design.md`.
- Rollout plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-06-cytnx-unitensor-method-rollout.md`.
- Coverage is machine-enforced: `python tools/validate_doc.py UniTensor docs/api-audit/UniTensor/`
  passes iff every live member is covered by some category's `# R.` section.

## Internal / plumbing (not public API)

The private/plumbing surface — the raw `c*`/shim bindings that leak into
`dir(cytnx.UniTensor)` — is analyzed in full in
[`private-surface.md`](private-surface.md): every leaked member classified with
its public wrapper and hide fix (**21** leaked members today), the
single-underscore internals, and the user-facing vs framework dunders. That
document is the single home for the private surface, machine-enforced by the
N-private accounting gate in `tools/validate_doc.py`.
